<p><span class='first-letter'>T</span>his article is for beginners as well as for the experts ðŸ˜‰,Â 
as this is going to help you to avoid all the pitfalls that could lead to failure state.</p>

Here, you will learn efficient way to start the projects and push it into Github/Gitlab.

Letâ€™s see what we are going to learn in this article:

1. Synchronize Local with Remote 
2. Working on Branch
3. Status of your work
4. Land your work

## Setup Git

Make sure to configure the **user information** which will be used across all repositories.

> Set the user name:
    `$ git config --global user.username`


> Set the Email Address:
    `$ git config --global user.email`

Once you have done the setup, will be able to push the changes into github.

### 1. Synchronize Local with Remote

It is important to always ensure that you have the repository on your local machine. There are two things can happen:

A. **You can create your *own repository* **

1. Go to the repository directoy

    ```sh
    $ cd project-name
    ```
    
2. Initialize the git

    ```sh
    $ git init
    ```

B. **If you are working from others repository**

1. To clone the repository locally.
    ```sh
    $ git clone [git@github.com](mailto:git@github.com):suprabhasupi/suprabha.me.git
    ```
    
    Yuppy! Now have cloned the repository local.

### 2. Branch

Git branches are effectivelyÂ a pointer to a snapshot of your changes.
You can create a new branch anytime when you have to work on any feature, fix, or any chore issues. 

**Why do you need to create a branch?** 

You create a branch to ensure that `main` branch should always a production ready code.
You can create a new branch by following command:

`$ git branch branch_name`

The above command will create a new branch. So to confirm the branch names you can enter following command:

```sh
$ git branch

main
branch_name
```

To switch from `main` to `branch_name`, or any other branch:

```sh
$ git checkout branch_name
```

If you want to create a new branch and switch into it, you can use following command:

```sh
$ git checkout -b branch_name
```
The above command will create a new branch and switched to `branch_name` branch.

### 3. Status

When you want to track the work you've done, such as which files you've updated
Here is the command to check status of your work:

```sh
$ git status
```

### 4. Land your work

Letâ€™s add, commit and push your work into the remote repository.

> add a single file:
    `$ git add file_name`

> add all files:
    `$ git add .`

> commit your code with valid message:
    `$ git commit -m â€œinitial commitâ€œ`

> push your work:
    `$ git push origin branch_name`

> to check your commit log:
    `$ git log`

> merge local_branch to another_branch:
    `$ git merge branch_name`

### Here are a few tips that can help you save time when working with Git:

1. **Letâ€™s say you have deleted a file a month back, but one day you needed it. How can you get the latest state of the file which has been already deleted?**
    
    **Ans:** This is the command which help you to find the commit log of that particular file:
    ```sh
    $ git log --full-history -- ${file_path}
    ```
    The above command finds the commitID that deleted the file. 
    After checking the commits, and backed up one more by entering the below command:
    ```sh
    $ git checkout HEAD~1
    ```
    This loads the file right before it was deleted ðŸ™Œ
    

2. **Resolve Conflict**
    
    Letâ€™s say, you took a pull from main branch and you had a conflict. 
    There are few command which will help you in terms of fixing or aborting the conflict.
    
    This command will help to see list of commits which caused conflict
    ```sh
    $ git log --merge
    ```
    
    > Once you fix the conflict, make sure to commit and push.
    
    The below command helps to exit from the merge process and back to original state.
    ```sh
    $ git merge --abort
    ```
    
3. **How to check staged changes of any tracked files. Letâ€™s say you have added the file and now you wanted to checkout the changes. This is the following command you can use:**
    ```sh
    $ git add file1.jsx
    $ git diff --cached file1.jsx
    ```
    

4. **Do you know you can store temporary commits as well in local?**

    Yes, you can stash your changes and when you want those changes back you can get it back.
    
    *Check out these important commands:*
    
    > To save temporary the updated changes:
        `$ git stash`
    
    > To check the list of stash stack:
        `$ git stash list`
    
    > Get the last stash changes from stash stack:
        `$ git stash pop`
    
    > Delete the last stash changes from the stash stack:
        `$ git stash drop`
